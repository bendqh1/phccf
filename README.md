# PHP RTL Contact Form

A CMS-agnostic HTML-JavaScript-CSS-PHP simple contact form with Right To Left (RTL) support which allows appointment setting.

The user's email address should be setted at `contact_form.php`.

I recommend double ensure that PHP files are not accessible by a browser, to prevent an hardcoded email address from being leaked to spambots.
